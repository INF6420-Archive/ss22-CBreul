            <h3>In Strange Lands</h3>
                <p>The crew has found themselves in the distant land of Nettep, a city carved out amongst the intensly lush rainforest that surrounds it. But this is no ordinary rainforest - wild magic runs deep through the roots of this forest, giving birth to both beauty and abomination. Among the beautiful is Knot's parent tree; a gargantuan magnolia which brings peace and safety to those in its presence. But wild magic always has teeth, and the Primals of Nettep have plenty to spare. These unnaturally large dinosaur-like creatures are wreaking havoc in the woods around Nettep - adding only to the political turmoil brewing within.</p>
