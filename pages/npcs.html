                        King Varuuk, known as the Beast King, is the founder of Nettep. Having an intense bond and ability to communicate with animals, he was able to bond with the dinosaurs that roam the rainforest, and introduced them as companions/working animals. He recently lost his long-time wife, and had recently taken up with Zihu, a Yuan-ti dancer.

                  Lupey Mergen is an eccentric artificer-slash-chemist, who holes up in her potion shop with her trusty famiiar, a semi-sentient blimp. She has a deep knowledge of the rainforest's plants and shelves full of potions and books. She seems indifferent to the political unrest fomenting in Nettep, content to study in her own space.

                   A massive Tyrannosaurus covered in teeth, Galta is one of the three Primals stalking Nettep. Her hunger cannot be sated, despite constantly eating. She can compel her prey to approach her (charm), as well as influence creatures around her to become similarly bloodthirsty. From the plane of Pandemonium, she leaks planar corruption which can physically alter living beings around her, such as plants.
