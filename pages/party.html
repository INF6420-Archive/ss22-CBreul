From left to right: Knot, a tall human-looking tree with deer antlers gestures with an open hand. Freja, a tall blue-green half orc stands with her bow at the ready, muscled legs poised for battle. Siw, a celestial paladin, stands proudly in her shining silver armor, with her long purple hair left loose. Gravlox, a red Tiefling warlock with small horns protruding from his forehead (and former party member), stands in the middle wields a crossbow while in a deep lunge. Liyf, the halfling cleric of Loviatar, looks confidently forward, with one hand holding a shortsword, the other ready to sling spells. Mab, a purple Tiefling illusion wizard, with tall, Kudu-like horns and glowing gold eyes, triumphantly makes a profane gesture to the viewer. Janaan, a blue water Genasi monk, stands ready for action, her long blue hair floating as though it were in water. Mikrok, a statuesque green Dragonborn fighter/war mage, lurks silently, his trusty great axe resting on his armor-clad shoulder. Taddy Mason, a massive, well-dressed Goliath bard, is not pictured.">
